## Description
CyberWorX is a community of white hat hackers and programmers that want to create a safer space in the cyber world whereby companies and users are able to use the internet, websites, web apps and mobiles apps safely by helping companies secure their systeam from potential attacks. We bring together companies and cyber security researchers who help the companies secure thier systems in a better and much safer way by patching the existing bugs in their systems. We move away from the traditional way of hiring penetester since a standard penetration test is time-bound and assesses a single moment in time.

Kickstart your bug bounty program and protect your assets every hour of every day, and every week. Cost effective & simple. Launch in a few clicks with the help of our customer success team. We make sure you only provide a bounty reward for unique and previously unknown security vulnerability reports. Every incoming submission is validated by our team of experts before it reaches you.
